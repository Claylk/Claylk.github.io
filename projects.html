                    <p class="body">For the Robotics for Space Exploration design team (at the University of Toronto), I created a ROS node that controls a mechanical arm mounted atop our rover.</p>
                    <p class="body">The primary goal of the node is to reduce the arm's jerk when moving between two points, ensuring safety and durability. It does this by generating a polynomial curve for each motor that drives the arm, which has zero velocity at the end points.
                                       A PID controller helps to compensate for error between calculated angles and sensor data from CAN.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body">The node was written for ROS 1 using Python.</p>

                    <p class="body">Two groupmates and I are currently creating a GIS system, although they are probably not fond of the name I've given it.</p>
                    <p class="body">The application uses the Open Street Map database and a graphics library provided by the University of Toronto (ezgl). My most challenging responsibilities for this project were implementing the A Star search algorithm, an autocompleted search bar in GTK, and creating the animations for the map (such as the one shown in the video). It's been a lot of fun and we hope to continue refining it towards the end of the semester.</p>
                    <p class="body">I wanted to link a Github here, but unfortunately I might get kicked out of school if someone decides to copy it.</p>
